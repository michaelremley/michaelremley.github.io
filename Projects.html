				<h1>Human Motion Project, 2016 - Present</h1>
				<p>From starting a project wanting to build a prosthetic foot to designing portable human motion measurement system today, this project has changed lot over the years. The Human Motion Project seeks to expand accessibility human motion data to remote and underpriveledged places by creating a system is based on inertial sensors instead of camera arrays. I am currently working on the fourth major prototype of the measurement device, focusing now on how the user experience for both researchers and hobbyists. The other members of this project team and I are currently seeking a patent sponsorship for our work.

				<h1>The Wanderer, 2019</h1>
				<p>We built a walking robot, called the Wanderer, that uses OpenCV to see people as it wanders around. When it sees people, it greets them, and when the people leave it says goodbye. I learned about robotic systems integration in this project by designing power circuitry and connecting all electrical hardware for the software subteam. I also worked in the mechanical subteam to ensure internal components had enough space in the final assembly.

				<h1>Minibeacon Project, 2018 - Present</h1>
				<p>In the weather balloon research group HARBOR, we track the balloon
					in multiple ways. The Minibeacon is a line-of-sight tracker mainly
					used as tertiary tracking and for recovery. One device with the balloon, transmitting its position data to a ground
					unit that indicates the distance, azimuth, and angle of elevation to balloon. Other devices on the balloon measure particulates and certain chemicals in the air, which we then use for research. Cameras also often fly on the balloon, giving great photos and further material for research.

				<h1>NEATO Robotics, 2019</h1>
				<p>In the course, Quantitative Engineering Analysis, we were tasked with guiding a robot called a NEATO through an obstacle course to a bucket. I used the LIDAR sensor and wheel encoder data to reconstruct the challenge environment as line segments in the plane with a point as the target position of the bucket. I took these line segments and target point as input for a potential field function, creating an overall downhill slope to the target with uphill regions representing obstacles. The robot then follows a path around obstacles to the target by executing a gradient descent algorithm on the potential field.

				<h1>Red Cube Platformer, 2019</h1>
				<p> This game written in Python with the Pygame module allows the player to run around a randomly generated side-scrolling level set. The game allows the player to run, jump, wall-jump, and climb on the ceiling using a simple physics/collision engine made from scratch. Made for Software Design, this project's focus was on creating an interactive program; Skye Ozga and I chose to make this game because we have enjoyed similar games in the past. I still update this every once in a while, and you can view the most recent source code on <a href="https://github.com/michaelremley/Red-Cube-Platformer"target="_blank"><u>my GitHub</u></a>.
