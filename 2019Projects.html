            <h5>Summary</h5>
            In the course, Quantitative Engineering Analysis, we were tasked with guiding a robot called a NEATO
    					through an obstacle course to a bucket. I used the LIDAR sensor and wheel encoder data to
    					reconstruct the challenge environment as line segments in the plane with a point as the target
    					position of the bucket. I took these line segments and target point as input for a potential field
    					function, creating an overall downhill slope to the target with uphill regions representing
    					obstacles. The robot then follows a path around obstacles to the target by executing a gradient
    					descent algorithm on the potential field.

              A foot traffic heatmapping utility to inform retail store layout and provide information about
              shopper habits. This project uses computer vision to identify where people are in a video and
              determines where in frame they spend most of their time.

              <h5>Summary</h5>
              We built a walking robot, called the Wanderer, that uses OpenCV to see people as it wanders around.
      					When it sees people, it greets them, and when the people leave it says goodbye. I learned about
      					robotic systems integration in this project by designing power circuitry and connecting all
      					electrical hardware for the software subteam. I also worked in the mechanical subteam to ensure
      					internal components had enough space in the final assembly.
