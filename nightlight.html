    <h2 class="display-4">Design for Brand</h2>
    <p>We were given a finished light board for this project, and we chose a fantasy brand. Glowing mushrooms are magical and mysterious, so they fit both the brand and nightlight aspects of the project. The bright colors and organic shapes further support this brand in my version of the design, while the plain white of my partner's version is more ghostly.</p>

    <h2 class="display-4">Design for Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>One focus of this project was to learn cost-effective design techniques for medium batch manufacturing. As a result, I gained design experience with thermo-formed plastics and electronics enclosures. To minimize the number of required fasteners, most parts are press fit in place or glued. The circuit is fastened screwed to the stump base for the learning experience of heat-set inserts, even though a snap-fit would be less-expensive.</p>

    <p>Our design has a relatively large number of parts. The stump is 3D printed with heat-set inserts to hold the light board in place. The stump cap is press fit over the board with the LEDs on wires sticking through. Each mushroom has a thermo-formed cap and gill glued together to a 3D printed stem. The LEDs are fed through the stems as the stems press-fit into the enclosure cap to complete the permanent assembly. The button/battery cover is 3D printed to look like gnomes and sits very loosely on top of the buttons.</p>

    <p>In my version, I made the button and battery cover look like two gnomes. The battery is a CR2032 that sits under the black pot, while the gnomes are button caps for power and mode control of the nightlight. To make the mushrooms glow, we modified the given light board to put the LEDs on wires leading up the hollow stems.</p>

    <p>We concluded after completing this prototype that the base stump primarily drove the cost for the design due to its volume and the cost of 3D printing. Another cost-driver was the labor of painting these parts by hand. Overall, this was a great opportunity to learn the dos and don'ts of manufacturing design!</p>
