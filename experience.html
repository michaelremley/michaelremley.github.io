            <h5>Summary</h5>
              In the scientific sense, chaos refers to systems that are incredibly sensitive to initial conditions. The Lorenz system is a famous example, and my faculty sponsor, Diana Dabby, for this research knew him personally. Our work continues her master's research into harnessing chaos to create musical variation (e.g. remixes and mashups). Our research included two projects: for summer and fall 2020 I was tasked with building a website and for spring 2021 I was tasked with designing and building a museum exhibit. The Lorenz system has two strange attractors pictured to the right. <a href="http://cantovario.com/">Learn more</a>

            Engineering Systems Analysis, or ESA for short, is a class that follows QEA to teach important systems-related math. We lead students into the mysterious s-domain and z-domain worlds and teach them to use them via a project where they balance an inverted pendulum robot named Rocky. This course is fairly new as of writing, so I have spent time revising assignments and creating solution keys for assessment.

            <h5>Summary</h5>
            Quantitative Engineering Analysis, or QEA for short, is a 8-credit hour class that combines physics, algebra, and engineering into a series of team-based projects. The eigenfaces project teaches linear algebra up to eigenvectors using a primitive facial recognition program and focuses on the ethics of technology. I provided some assets to make the remote version of the robotics module, which ran in a simulator in Spring 2020, more engaging and friendly to the students. One of these is pictured to the right.

            <h5>Summary</h5>
            In summer 2019, I found myself without an engineering-related job and took the opportunity to try something completely new and different. This job was as miserable as it sounds; we lug molds, tools, and stakes all day in the 80-100 degree heat. It took me completely out of my comfort zone, but I learned a lot of important things from the change in perspective. I was by far the smallest, lightest guy on the team, so I was the natural choice to get into tight places as shown to the right.
