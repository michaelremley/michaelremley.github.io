            <h5>Summary</h5>
              <p>I worked on two projects in OSSTP: an interference validation tool that satellite constellations must satisfy to launch and a textbook for an Olin course called Analog and Digital Communication. Written in MATLAB, the software tool simulates the orbits of the system in question according to precession models provided by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). While doing so, the software calculates how much interference is observed by a victim satellite on the geostationary (GSO) arc or a victim earth station via the equivalent power flux density (EPFD) metric. Satellite networks only pass the examination if they are below the statistical EPFD limits provided by the ITU.</p>

              <p>My contributions to the EPFD validation software was the database API, orbital simulation, geometry, and EPFDup (GSO satellite victim) direction evaluation. Other members of the team were able to use shared classes and methods to perform validation for EPFDdown (GSO earth station victim). I also contributed documentation to help future team members understand the governing document of this project, ITU S.1503.</p>

              <p>I was the project lead for the Analog and Digital Communication (ADC) textbook. With lecture slides and notes to guide the structure of the book, I wrote more than 95% of the content and created dozens of original figures. The textbook introduces mathematical tools such as the Fourier transform, convolution, and frequency-domain analysis so that students can understand and implement amplitude and frequency modulation. After simulated and real-world work with AM and FM signals, the textbook introduces statistical tools used to quantify noise, bit-error rates, power, and other important metrics of communication systems. Students spend the rest of the course learning about pulse amplitude modulation up to and including the matched filter and quadrature amplitude modulation. </p>
              <p> In Fall 2021, I am a course assistant using the first edition textbook as an evolving teaching tool, responding to feedback from the class and others on the teaching team.</p>

            <h5>Summary</h5>
              In the scientific sense, chaos refers to systems that are incredibly sensitive to initial conditions. The Lorenz system is a famous example, and my faculty sponsor, Diana Dabby, for this research knew him personally. Our work continues her master's research into harnessing chaos to create musical variation (e.g. remixes and mashups). Our research included two projects: for summer and fall 2020 I was tasked with building a website and for spring 2021 I was tasked with designing and building a museum exhibit. The Lorenz system has two strange attractors pictured to the right. <a href="http://cantovario.com/">Learn more</a>

            Engineering Systems Analysis, or ESA for short, is a class that follows QEA to teach important systems-related math. We lead students into the mysterious s-domain and z-domain worlds and teach them to use them via a project where they balance an inverted pendulum robot named Rocky. This course is fairly new as of writing, so I have spent time revising assignments and creating solution keys for assessment.

            Quantitative Engineering Analysis, or QEA for short, is a 8-credit hour class that combines physics, algebra, and engineering into a series of team-based projects. The eigenfaces project teaches linear algebra up to eigenvectors using a primitive facial recognition program and focuses on the ethics of technology. I provided some assets to make the remote version of the robotics module, which ran in a simulator in Spring 2020, more engaging and friendly to the students. One of these is pictured to the right.

            <h5>Summary</h5>
            In summer 2019, I found myself without an engineering-related job and took the opportunity to try something completely new and different. This job was as miserable as it sounds; we lug molds, tools, and stakes all day in the 80-100 degree heat. It took me completely out of my comfort zone, but I learned a lot of important things from the change in perspective. I was by far the smallest, lightest guy on the team, so I was the natural choice to get into tight places as shown to the right.
