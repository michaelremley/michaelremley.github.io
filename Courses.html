            This is an introduction to fluid and heat transport.
            It makes light use of vector calculus to eventual solve simple fluid problems with Navier-Stokes equations and heat conduction problems.
            Our first project was to build a wind measurement device using what we had learned about steady fluid physics.
            I built a wind tunnel with a deflection lift-based airfoil where the angle of attack is a function of wind speed.
            The final project has not started at the time of writing.

            Following Microelectronic Circuits, this class traces how computers work from gate-level design to entire CPU's.
            We started with adders and lookup tables, some of which I built in Minecraft for fun, then we move into clocked elements.
            The final lab is building a MIPs CPU with most standard operations except for floating-point math.
            My partner and I are expanding the final lab CPU to support the full instruction set and run arbitrary C code compiled to MIPs assembly.

            <h5>In My Words</h5>
              Engineers have historically lacked formal training on complete lifetime analysis of what they design, and this class is meant to create a better engineer who can avoid environmental damage in their work.
              Of course we should consider the social/environmental issues of materials, but how do we do it? The class also covers some introductory material science in the context of metals.
              This means we learn the basic properties of metals such as crystal structures and metallurgy.
              I wrote my final paper on the massive copper mine near where I live to see if it resembles any of the notorious superfund sites in the United States. (Look up Tar Creek for an example)

              This course explores materials science through the lens of metallic materials and their environmental and social impacts.
              From iron and aluminum in mechanical structures, to cobalt and rare earth metals in electronics and renewable energy applications, today's technologies rely on metals and alloys for their unique physical and chemical properties.
              Metals are part of a larger technological system, however, with complex social, environmental, political, economic, and ethical implications.
              Through a series of projects, students in this class will explore the technical processing, microstructure, and behaviors of metallic materials, while researching and discussing sustainability issues related to mining operations, raw material processing, and recycling and disposal.
              We will critically examine the social and environmental costs of the metals industry and metallic products, and consider our professional and ethical responsibilities as scientists, engineers, designers and global citizens to address larger problems or initiate positive change.
              The course takes place in a studio-laboratory setting, where teams will implement self-directed project plans guided by their own interests and goals, apply a range of materials testing and analytical techniques, and produce a range of project deliverables that reflect an interdisciplinary understanding of metallic materials and their impacts.

              UOCD is course about the people part of engineering. In short, we explore a "user group" in great detail and only design something for them in the very last week.
              So, most of the class is about understanding how a user group works by interviewing them and digesting that information in a variety of ways.
              My group chose librarians as our user group, and we were lucky to have tech-savvy participants when school went remote.
              In the end, we decided to revamp the bulletin board into something more inviting after learning about librarians' passion for people and dissappointment when someone does not know what resources are available.

                Students develop detailed concepts and models of authentic new products and services. Our focus is on user-oriented, collaborative approaches to design and seeking holistic solutions integrating user and functional perspectives. We emphasize the importance of process and the development of strategies. Students observe and engage people to develop a deep understanding of their values and the patterns of their lives. They work collaboratively in a studio environment to create a shared understanding of the people they design for (and with) and the product ideas they develop. Topics covered include design thinking, ethnographic methods, concept development and interaction design.

          Each third of the class covers one of the different methods, and the final project was to write a paper with your own model of understanding identity.
          My proposed model asserts that every method has blind spots and that all three must be used together to get a full picture.

        The application of quantitative analysis of mathematical models and/or data can enable, improve, and speed up the engineering design process. Using quantitative analysis to answer engineering questions, you will be able to make the choices necessary to successfully complete an engineering design. Whether you are selecting the best part from a catalog, choosing an appropriate material, sizing a component, determining the effect of certain influences on your design, or optimizing your design within a parameter space, you often need to obtain (through experiment or calculation) and interpret quantitative information to inform your decisions. There are many different approaches to getting and interpreting the data you need: you may conduct an experiment, do a rough estimation, perform a detailed calculation based on mathematical models, or create a computer simulation. If you want to engineer effectively, you must be able to choose and use appropriate quantitative tools for a given situation.

        In this class, you will be introduced to various approaches to perform quantitative engineering analysis through real-world examples. You will learn how to select between different tools and different approaches within the context of an engineering challenge, how to use many different tools for quantitative analysis, and how to acquire new tools on your own in the future.

        Analog and Digital Communications is all about how AM/FM radio works.
        After taking this class and learning the professor was moving on, I chose to be a course assistant to pass along as much of his expertise with teaching the class as possible.
        There are hundreds of tiny details from him that I am currently trying to preserve for future iterations of the course.
        Students must become comfortable with frequency domain math to understand how all radio systems work.
        We optimize system parameters to meet power, datarate, and error requirements.
        One of the most interesting things to me was the mathematics of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). It blew my mind that one can turn a real-valued channel into a complex-valued signal with just sinusoidal waves.
        My final project was an IC-level construction of conventional AM radio, consisting of an oscillator, multplier, transmitter gain, receiver, and receiver speaker.

        I brought the working computer vision code to the team, but I became responsible for coordinating the parts between mechanical, electrical, and software parts.
        In short, I made sure the mechanical team knew how to size things and the software team had the power and connections they needs.
        I designed the power and motor setup within.

        Through a significant project experience, students will learn to integrate analysis, qualitative design, quantitative optimization, experiments, and simulations to improve their ability to engineer real systems. In each section of the course, students will work in small multidisciplinary teams to design and to build a mechatronic system of their own choosing. Each project must include both a nontrivial mechanical system design and a nontrivial electronic system design involving both hardware and software components. Projects will be subject to realistic materials, process, and budgetary constraints.

        Immunology is unsurprisingly about the immune system. It includes lab work, research papers, and a little bit of historical writing.
        I wrote my final research paper about antimicrobial peptides to develop a hypothesis that vitamin D3 and calcium are a critical component of passive immunity.
        Interestingly, vitamin D3 seems to be critical to the body's COVID-19 response, though I wrote this paper in November 2019 before COVID was in our minds.
        Our lab work was an attempt to observe the DNA of some antimicrobial peptides from keratinocytes, but we were not sucessful.

        Immunology is a relatively new science, and our understanding of our immune system is evolving at a rapid pace. When the immune system functions properly, infectious pathogens and potential cancer cells are destroyed. When our immune system malfunctions, normally harmless microorganisms can cause serious infections, autoimmune diseases or allergies can develop and cancer cells can evade immune surveillance and grow unchecked. In this lecture and discussion-based class, we will investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control our immune responses. Current research in immunology will be emphasized through analysis of primary literature and media articles.

        Software Design is an introduction to programming design ideas for students with some background in Python.
        One of my projects was a little platform game written with Pygame.
        Our team's final project employed computer vision to figure out traffic in public spaces.
        The result is a heatmap superimposed on the picture, so it looks like the floor is lava, hence the name.

        This course is an introduction to software design. It focuses on a model of computation as a set of simultaneous ongoing entities embedded in and interacting with a dynamic environment, for example: computation as it occurs in spreadsheets, video games, web applications, and robots. A major component of the class is a weekly three-hour, in class laboratory. Much of this laboratory is spent in collaborative work on program development, with an emphasis on student-student interaction and student-student teaching, facilitated and enriched by the course staff. In addition, design and implementation work is supplemented with observational laboratory assignments, inviting students to consider not only how to build a program, but how to anticipate its behavior and how to modify that behavior. Both students with no prior background and students with background comparable to the CS AP should both find this course interesting and worthwhile.

        Entrepreneur: one who owns and manages a business; a person who takes the risk of profit or loss. - O.E.D. The same source also reveals a broader definition found in the French root, entreprendre, which means "to undertake." An entrepreneur is defined as one who assumes the opportunity and full responsibility of any pursuit. A champion.

        In this course, students explore and begin to realize in themselves the entrepreneur in both forms: the practical and the profound. In this foundational course in business and entrepreneurship they will conceive, create, and manage a real, profitable business. They will be exposed to traditional business tools such as accounting, marketing, and finance as well as the personal and interpersonal tools requisite for high-performance teamwork, including project planning, giving feedback, and persuasive pitching. This business experience and its associated challenges will serve as the context in which we hope to develop broader self-awareness, productive self-reflection, and courage. Broadly, these skills will apply to the bold imagining and realization of their lives at Olin and beyond.

        ISIM is a required first year course presenting a series of labs to teach electrical basics.
        Many of the labs are based on RC circuits, including a light-based and a bathroom scale-based heart rate monitor.
        We dabbled in frequency domain with Bode plots of our RC and Opamp circuit responses.
        My final project was a simple transparency sensor. My partner and I wanted to do a snow density measurement device, but it didn't snow in time!

        Conducting experiments and making measurements is an essential aspect of all branches of science and engineering. Nearly all of our current quantitative understanding of the natural and engineered world has come from the interplay between theory and measurements. Models and simulations of systems require experimental validation and performance of engineered systems must not only be predicted, but also measured and tested. In this course we will learn the basic tools of making physical measurements and conducting experiments. We will collect data, analyze data, conduct basic error analysis, and design experimental systems. Using inexpensive modern sensors, we will build the necessary supporting electronics and learn to collect data with computer based data acquisition systems. The first part of the course will focus on individual work and students will conduct labs on basic electrical, mechanical and environmental measurements. The later part of the course will involve a team project that involves designing and executing an experiment that involves measurement, data acquisition and data analysis.

        Design Nature is a fundamental design course split into two big projects: a hopper project where we invent a character for a Lego Minifigure and design a hopper for them, then a play experience project where we design a play experience for children.
        The greatest challenge of the hopper project is the delay requirement. The hopper must sit for 3 seconds before it jumps without any outside input. My hopper's focus was durability to keep the minifigure within safe, and I am still able to stand on it without it collapsing.
        Our final project culminated in a wall of honeycombs with yellow bean bags where kids would form two teams and try to throw the bees past to get into the hive. We called this "Defend the Hive", and it seemed like kids really enjoyed it during the final event.
        We did prior research by calling a Kindergarten class to see what kids wanted from games, and it was fun thinking about what they would want!

        We take nature, an important source of inspiration and understanding, as a theme and develop bioinspired ideas into functional prototypes. Our focus is on the general principles and methods that shape the practice of engineering design. Students complete individual and team projects in a studio environment where we seek to develop a shared practice and understanding of engineering design. Students also gain experience in visualization, experimentation, estimation, fabrication, and presentation as they relate to designing.
